> __3 April 2023 Alert__: [Recent changes to Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/commit/ca417d32578c3b6224c5aa8df56eb776712941b7) may cause Vaultwarden to fail to start due to default environmental variables. `.env.template` has been updated in this repo, however, if you are affected, you must also update `.env` and comment out all `YUBICO_*` variables, so that they appear as:
>
> ```
> #YUBICO_CLIENT_ID=
> #YUBICO_SECRET_KEY=
> #YUBICO_SERVER=
> ```
> Restart with `docker-compose`, and Vaultwarden should come up as normal. Credit to [@AySz88 for reporting this](https://github.com/dadatuputi/bitwarden_gcloud/issues/54).
