### BITWARDEN VARIABLES ###

# Setting up Bitwarden for the first time can be done in two ways:
# Uncomment the method you want to use / comment the one you don't
# Method 1. [RECOMMENDED] because it avoids the admin page entirely; using the admin
#   page overrides these environmental variables which can cause confusion.
#   1. Set up your primary account(s) while SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=true
#   2. Set SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=false
#   3. Set the SMTP details above to enable e-mail invitation
#   4. Invite other users from within Bitwarden
#   Keep ADMIN_TOKEN blank to disable access to the admin page entirely.
SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=true
ADMIN_TOKEN=
# Method 2. Use the admin page to create your first user(s) then disable it.
#   1. Set ADMIN_TOKEN using gthe command `openssl rand -base64 48`
#   2. Use the admin page (/admin) to create your initial user(s).
#   3. Disable the admin page by clearing the token (ADMIN_TOKEN=)
#SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=false
#ADMIN_TOKEN=

# Specify YUBIKEY info if desired
